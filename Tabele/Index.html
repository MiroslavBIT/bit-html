    <p>After formation, the regiment was transferred by railroad to Corinth, Mississippi, as part of the Army of the
        West.[10] An accounting of the regiment's troops during a May 5, 1862 muster listed 547 men in the regiment.[11]
        On May 9, the 4th Missouri Infantry was near the action at the Battle of Farmington and deployed, but did not
        enter the fray. After the Confederates evacuated Corinth due to Union pressure, the regiment trained in several
        locations in northern Mississippi.[10] Price was in command of the Army of the West, which he had stationed at
        Iuka, Mississippi; Van Dorn had troops further to the south. The Confederates were conducting an offensive into
        Kentucky, and Price and Van Dorn were expected to move into Tennessee to support it. Major General Ulysses S.
        Grant, who was the Union commander in the region, attempted to trap Price before he could join Van Dorn, but the
        Confederates were able to escape after fighting the Battle of Iuka.[12] At this time, the 4th Missouri Infantry
        was in Brigadier General Martin E. Green's brigade, which was held in reserve and did not fight at Iuka.[10]

        After escaping, Price joined Van Dorn, who commanded the combined force. Together, the Confederates moved
        against Corinth, which was strategically important to Union plans in the region. On October 2, Union Major
        General William S. Rosecrans occupied Corinth with 23,000 men; that same day, he learned of Van Dorn's approach.
        After arriving near the city, the Confederates deployed in an arc northwest of the Union defenses with 22,000
        men. At 10:00 a.m. on October 3, Van Dorn attacked, beginning the Second Battle of Corinth.[13] At Corinth, the
        4th Missouri Infantry was still part of Green's brigade, which was in Brigadier General Louis Hébert's division;
        Hébert's formation was in turn part of Price's corps within the Army of West Tennessee.[14] The 4th Missouri
        Infantry and the rest of Green's brigade (except for the artillery) attacked an outer Union position held by
        Brigadier General Thomas A. Davies's division. The initial attack was repulsed, but Green ordered a second
        charge, which was again repulsed, this time by a Union counterattack led by the 2nd Iowa Infantry.[15] Later in
        the afternoon, Green's brigade made another charge against Davies's line; this attack was supported by elements
        of Colonel Elijah Gates's and Brigadier General Charles W. Phifer's brigades. After heavy fighting, the Union
        line was broken. Despite an opportunity to attack the inner Union line, Price decided not to press the attack as
        only 30 minutes of daylight remained; instead he waited for the morning of the 4th to resume the battle.[16]

        After Hébert fell ill, Green was promoted to divisional command on October 4. Command of Green's brigade then
        fell to Colonel William H. Moore,[17] who led a charge against the inner Union line, in an effort to capture a
        fortification known as Battery Powell. The Union line was defended by men of Davies's division, who were quickly
        routed by the Confederate charge.[18] After breaking through Davies's line, Moore's brigade aimed for the town
        of Corinth itself.[19] Along with elements of Phifer's brigade and the brigade of Brigadier General John C.
        Moore, it entered Corinth, and penetrated as far as the Tishomingo Hotel. A Union counterattack drove the
        Confederates out of Corinth.[20] At Second Corinth, the 4th Missouri lost 129 men: 15 killed, 87 wounded, and 27
        missing.[10] MacFarlane suffered a serious head wound during the battle.[</p>

    <p>After the Siege of Corinth in May 1862, Maj. Gen. Henry Halleck was promoted to be general in chief of the Union
        Army and Maj. Gen. Ulysses S. Grant replaced him in command at Corinth, Mississippi. This command was smaller
        than Halleck's, however, because the Army of the Ohio under Maj. Gen. Don Carlos Buell now operated as a
        separate command, leaving Grant command of only his own Army of the Tennessee and Maj. Gen. William Rosecrans's
        Army of the Mississippi, together about 100,000 men. Since the Confederates had evacuated Corinth that summer,
        Grant's forces had been engaged in protecting supply lines in western Tennessee and northern Mississippi, with
        Maj. Gen. William Tecumseh Sherman's division in Memphis, Maj. Gen. Edward O. C. Ord's division guarding the
        Union supply line at Corinth, and Rosecrans's army holding the railroad from Corinth east to Iuka. As
        Confederate General Braxton Bragg moved north from Tennessee into Kentucky in September 1862, Buell pursued him
        from Nashville. The Confederates needed to prevent Buell from being reinforced by Grant's command.[3]

        Confederate Maj. Gen. Sterling Price had been ordered by Bragg to move his Army of the West from Tupelo toward
        Nashville, Tennessee, in conjunction with Bragg's Kentucky offensive. On September 13, his army reached the town
        of Iuka in northeastern Mississippi, about 20 miles east of Corinth. It was a small Union supply depot, the
        easternmost outpost that Grant had established on the Memphis and Charleston Railroad. Price's cavalry
        skirmished with pickets posted by the small Union garrison stationed there. On September 14, before dawn, the
        Union commander, Col. Robert C. Murphy of the 8th Wisconsin Infantry, set fire to the supplies of the depot and
        marched his 2,000-man brigade back to Corinth. The Confederates dashed in and doused the flames, reaping a large
        collection of valuable supplies. Rosecrans relieved Murphy and ordered him to be court-martialed.[4]

        Price's army settled in Iuka and awaited the arrival of Maj. Gen. Earl Van Dorn's Army of West Tennessee,
        approximately 7,000 men. The two generals intended to unite and attack Grant's lines of communication in western
        Tennessee, which would prevent Buell's reinforcement if Grant reacted the way they expected, or might allow them
        to follow Bragg and support his Northern invasion if Grant acted more passively.[5]

        Grant did not wait to be attacked, approving a plan to converge on Price with two columns before Van Dorn, four
        days march to the southwest, could reinforce him. Grant sent Ord with three Army of the Tennessee divisions
        (about 8,000 men) along the Memphis and Charleston Railroad to move to Burnsville, take the roads to the north
        of the railroad and move upon Iuka from the northwest. He also ordered Rosecrans's army on a coordinated move
        along the Mobile and Ohio Railroad that would bring two divisions (9,000 men) swinging into Iuka from the
        southwest, closing the escape route for Price's army, while the remainder of that army protected Corinth against
        any threat from Van Dorn. The relatively complex plan for the two-pronged assault was actually Rosecrans's, who
        had previously been stationed in Iuka and felt familiar with the area. Grant moved with Ord's headquarters and
        had little tactical control over Rosecrans during the battle.[6After the Siege of Corinth in May 1862, Maj. Gen.
        Henry Halleck was promoted to be general in chief of the Union
        Army and Maj. Gen. Ulysses S. Grant replaced him in command at Corinth, Mississippi. This command was smaller
